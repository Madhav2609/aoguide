The cosmological principle states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. This means that, on average, the universe looks the same in all directions (isotropic) and at all locations (homogeneous).

The fact that the night sky is dark, known as Olbers' Paradox, suggests that the universe is not static and infinite. If it were, we would see a bright sky filled with stars. Instead, we observe a dark night sky, which implies that the universe has a finite age and is expanding.

Another observation is the Hubble's Law (or Hubble-Lema√Ætre Law), which states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from us is proportional to its distance.

Redshift is defined as

$$ z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}} - \lambda_{\text{emit}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}}$$

where \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the wavelength of light observed and \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \) was its wavelength when it was emitted. Redshift can be caused due to multiple reasons, such as the Doppler effect, gravitational redshift, or cosmological redshift. If the object emitting light is moving at non-relativistic speeds, its speed can be related to the redshift by

$$ v = cz $$

A positive redshift indicates that the object is moving away from us, while a negative redshift indicates that it is moving towards us.

Hubble's Law states that

$$ v = H_0 d $$

where \( H_0 \) is the Hubble constant and \( d \) is the distance to the galaxy. The Hubble constant is a measure of the rate of expansion of the universe.

In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB), which is the remnant radiation from the Big Bang. The CMB is a nearly uniform background radiation that fills the universe and has a temperature of $T_0 = 2.725 \pm 0.001 \, \mathrm{K}$. The CMB is isotropic and homogeneous, which supports the cosmological principle. Given the temperature of the CMB, we can find its energy density and number density

$$ u_0 \approx 0.260 \, \mathrm{MeV \, c^{-2}} $$
$$ n_0 \approx 411 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m^{-3}} $$

Observations of the universe show that the oldest objects contain ~25% Helium by mass, the second most abundant element in the universe after Hydrogen.
