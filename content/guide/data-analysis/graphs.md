## Drawing Graphs

Drawing graphs is one of the most important aspects of data analysis. Questions in astronomy olympiads generally only ask to draw scatter plot graphs or histograms, with just a few exceptions. A good graph should be easy to read and interpret, and should clearly convey the information being presented. The key points to remember when drawing graphs are:

- Use a sharp pencil to draw graphs. Do not use pen on the graph paper.
- Mark and label the axes clearly with the units of measurement.
- Each tick on the axes need not be labeled. However, it should be easily deducible what value that tick represents.
- Use a suitable scale for the axes. The scale should be chosen so that the data is clearly visible and easy to interpret. State the scale used at the top of the graph.
- The origin of your graph does not have to be at (0, 0). It can be at any point on the graph, as long as it is clearly marked and labeled.
- All the given data points should be marked inside the green port
ion of the graph paper, so choose the scale accordingly. The data points should be marked on the green grid lines, and not inside the white boxes. Mark the data points on a graph by placing a small dot at the coordinates of the point and then drawing a small circle around the point to make it easily visible.
- The graph should cover at least 80% of the area of the graph paper.
- Every graph should have a title that clearly states which variables appear on the plot. Also, write your name and the date on the plot as well for convenient reference.
- The marked data points should be clearly visible and distinguishable from the background. If multiple data sets are plotted on the same graph, use different symbols for each. Legend should be provided for each symbol.
- If possible, turn the relation to be plotted into a linear form. For example, if the graph of $y$ vs $x$ follows the relation $y = bx^m$, plot $log(y)$ vs $log(x)$ or $y$ vs $x^m$ instead of $y$ vs $x$.
- The data points should be connected with a simple smooth curve or line. If a linear fit is used, write the equation of the line on the graph. The curve/line will not necessarily pass through all the points, but should pass as close as possible to each point, with about half the points on each side of the curve/line; this curve is intended to guide the eye along the data points and to indicate the trend of the data. Do not connect the data points by straight-line segments in a dot-to-dot fashion. The curve now indicates the average trend of the data, and any predicted values should be read from this curve rather than reverting back to the original data points.

## Choosing an appropriate scale

The scale of a graph is the ratio of the distance on the graph to the actual value. For example, if 1 cm on the graph represents 10 m/s of the actual value, then the scale is 1 cm = 10 m/s.

When choosing a scale for your graph, consider the range of your data and the level of detail you want to convey. Ideally, the scale should be of the form 1 cm = $2^m \cdot 5^n$ (units), which makes it very easy to read the coordinates of the data points. Other choices (e.g. 1 cm = 3 units) make both plotting and reading very hard.

Scales should be made no finer than the smallest increment on the measuring instrument from which data were obtained. For example, data from a meter stick (which has 1 mm graduations) should be plotted on a scale no finer than 1 cm = 1 mm. A scale finer than this would provide no additional plotting accuracy, since the data from the meter stick are only accurate to about 0.5 mm. Frequently the scale must be considerably coarser than this limit, in order to fit the entire plot onto a single sheet of graph paper.

## Drawing a linear fit

Place a transparent ruler or drafting triangle on your graph and adjust its position so that the edge is as close as possible to all the data points. The best adjustment will bring about one-half of the data points beneath the ruler, evenly distributed along the line. Draw a line along the ruler edge that extends to the nearest coordinate axis at one end and somewhat beyond the last data point at the other end. The degree to which the data are consistent with the equation is shown by how close the data points are to the fitted line. The construction of this straight line performs a smoothing of the raw experimental data, and thus may be a more reliable indication of the outcome of the experiment than any one pair of data points. Measurements taken from the graph should therefore be made on the fitted line and not on the data points themselves. Do not 'force' the fitted line to pass through some point (like the origin) of the graph, even if the original function passes through that point.

The slope of a straight line is computed by dividing the 'rise' by the 'run' of the line, as shown. For the 'run', choose two convenient scale locations along the horizontal axis near the ends of the line, and draw light vertical lines to intersect the plotted line. Read off the positions of these intersections along the vertical axis and subtract to obtain the 'rise'. Always report the calculated slope on the graph itself. You may find it helpful to label 'rise' and 'run' and intersection points as shown in the example, at least until your graphing technique is well developed. When you are asked to determine the intercept with the y-axis, label the intercept where the plotted line intersects the vertical axis (assuming that the vertical axis is located at the '0' position along the horizontal scale).

The uncertainty in the slope and intercept can be estimated by drawing two more straight lines with the maximum and minimum slope that still allows the lines to pass through most of the data points. The corresponding range of slopes and intercept values can then be used as a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in these values.
