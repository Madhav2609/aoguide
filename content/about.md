<div class="section-title">About AO Guide</div>

Hey, thanks for dropping by! We're grateful to have you here. Let's talk a bit about why we built AO Guide. 

When we were preparing for astronomy olympiads, we found ourselves (and others) jumping between massive textbooks (that had way more info than we needed), scattered handouts from random websites, and outdated materials that didn't really capture what IOAA was all about. It was honestly pretty overwhelming. Its understandable, they weren't really designed for IOAA in mind, but we wanted to fix this.

Therefore we built AO Guide. Its not a textbook or another handout, the main goal of AO Guide is to be 
*complete* and *concise*. That doesn't mean its just short, dry text without any motivation, we have actively
tried to do the exact opposite; but that it contains a lot more of what is needed for the olympiads.

<div class="subsection-title">What We're Really Trying to Do</div>

We wanted to create something that we wish we had when we started our olympiad journey:

1. **Everything you actually need** for IOAA ‚Äì no more, no less. We've been through this, so we know what matters.
2. **Built the way we learn** ‚Äì step by step, with plenty of examples and explanations that actually make sense.
3. **Modern and accessible** ‚Äì because studying shouldn't feel like punishment, and everyone deserves good resources.
4. **Visual and engaging** ‚Äì diagrams, and other interactive elements that help visualise concepts.
5. **Real problem-solving practice** ‚Äì not just theory, but the kind of problems you'll actually face in competitions.

<div class="subsection-title">Why This Exists</div>

Astronomy and astrophysics are incredible subjects that we really do love. But preparing for olympiads caused us a lot of frustations, and not for a lack of trying. Most textbooks were either too advanced, or woefully incomplete for IOAA. 

It was because of this frustation that we decided to write AO Guide. We don't really benefit much from it, its free for you to use and modify afterall! But honestly, just allowing for a far smoother way to learn for the next person who wanted to get into astronomy is quite rewarding in itself :) 

Olympiads aren't about memorizing formulas (though you do really need some of them). It's about really understanding how things work, being able to think through problems step by step, and having the confidence to tackle something you've never seen before. That's what we're trying to help you build, we have a plethora of problems with solutions for you to go through!

    <p>Hi! I'm a high school student from India and a Gold medalist from IOAA 2025. I love physics, astronomy and math, along with few other subjects (including but not limited to cs, linguistics, chemistry and engineering). I like mathematical rigor in solving problems, and I believe I have been succesfully able to reflect this in the guide. You can reach out to me on my <a href="https://discord.gg/bV8bxvTmzU" target="_blank">Discord server</a>, or dm me at @bunchofcells (I like cucumbers).</p>

    <p>I'm a high school student from India passionate about mathematics, physics, cs, literature, and philosophy (yes its a bit of a weird combo). I was a PROMYS 2025 Alumni, and was the leader of Physics Olympiad Co-operation for BL4S, which was shortlisted. I help make sure our explanations are correct, and most importantly clear! You can contact me at discord at @jardindelys, but do send a cat pic if you decide to :D</p>
