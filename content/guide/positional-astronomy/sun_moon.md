## Geocentric Path of the Sun

The sun appears to go around the Earth in a period of one year, following a path called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and it is tilted with respect to the celestial equator by about $23.5^\circ$. The sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, as it moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (at perihelion) and slower when it is farther away (at aphelion).

### Sunrise and Sunset

We are often asked to find the time of sunrise and sunset for a given location and date. The time of sunrise is the moment when the upper limb of the Sun appears above the horizon, while the time of sunset is the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon.

Say an object $X$ has the equatorial coordinates $(\alpha, \delta)$ and the observer's latitude is $\phi$. The hour angle $h$ of the object at the time of rising or setting is given by

$$\boxed{\cos h = -\tan \phi \tan \delta}$$

This gives two solutions for the hour angle $h$ in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. The solution lying in the interval $[-\pi, 0]$ corresponds to the time of rising, while the solution lying in the interval $[0, \pi]$ corresponds to the time of setting.

The azimuth $A$ of the object at the time of rising or setting is given by

$$\cos A = \sin \delta \sec \phi$$

where the solution of azimuth lying in the range $[0, \pi]$ corresponds to the time of rising, while the solution lying in the range $[\pi, 2\pi]$ corresponds to the time of setting.

This simple treatment however, does not give accurate results for the Sun, due to the effects of atmospheric refraction and the finite size of the solar disk. The Sun is not a point source, and its upper limb appears above the horizon when it is still below the horizon due to atmospheric refraction. The time of sunrise and sunset can be calculated more accurately by taking into account these effects.

Even after sunset, some sunlight is recieved by the observer by scattering off of the atmoshpere. This phenomena is called twilight. Civil twilight is defined as the time when the Sun is between $6^\circ$ below the horizon and the horizon, nautical twilight is defined as the time when the Sun is between $12^\circ$ below the horizon and $6^\circ$ below the horizon, and astronomical twilight is defined as the time when the Sun is between $18^\circ$ below the horizon and $12^\circ$ below the horizon. The times of these twilights can be calculated using similar formulas as above, with appropriate values for $\delta$.

### Seasons

### Tilted plane of the ecliptic

Due to the axial tilt of the Earth, the Sun's decliniation $\delta$ varies throughout the year, causing the seasons. The Sun reaches its maximum declination of $23.5^\circ$ at the summer solstice (around June 21) and its minimum declination of $-23.5^\circ$ at the winter solstice (around December 21). The equinoxes occur when the Sun's declination is $0^\circ$, around March 21 (vernal equinox) and September 23 (autumnal equinox).

If the observer's latitude is numerically less than $23.5^\circ$, there will be two occasions each year when the Sun is directly overhead the observer ($\phi = \delta$). If the observer's latitude is numerically greater than $23.5^\circ$, there will be no occasions when the Sun is directly overhead the observer. If the observer's latitude is numerically equal to $23.5^\circ$, the Sun will be directly overhead at the tropic of Cancer (north) and the tropic of Capricorn (south) only once, at the summer and winter solstices respectively.

If the latitude of the observer is numerically greater than $66.5^\circ$, the Sun will remain below the horizon for at least one full day during some part of the year and above horizon for at least one full day during some other part of the year. The phenomena when the Sun doesn't set even at midnight is known as the midnight sun, and when it does not rise is called the polar night. The small circle at latitude $66.5^\circ$ is called the Arctic Circle in the northern hemisphere and the Antarctic Circle in the southern hemisphere.

At the poles, the Sun remains above the horizon for six months during summer and below the horizon for six months during winter.

The amount of hear recieved from the sun and the daily average temperature of a place is highly independent of the distance from the Sun. Amounth of energy arriving per unit area is propotional to the inclinaition of the Sun's rays hitting the surface of the Earth. The more direct the rays, the more energy is received per unit area. This is why the equator is hotter than the poles, as the Sun's rays are more direct at the equator.

$$E \propto \cos (\phi - \delta)$$

where $E$ is the amount of energy received per unit area, $\phi$ is the observer's latitude, and $\delta$ is the Sun's declination.
