## Gravitational Lensing

A gravitational lens is matter that bends light from a distant source as it travels towards an observer.

Strong lensing is when there are easily visible distortions, such as the formation of Einstein rings, arcs or multiple images of the same source.

Weak lensing does not produce arcs or muliple images, but only flattens the shape of the source.

Microlensing is when no distortion in shape can be seen but the amount of light recieved from a background object changes.

The impact parameter $\xi$ is the shortest separation between the center of the lens and path of a particular light ray. Here L is the massive object which bends the light emitted from S. The observed images are S$_1$ and S$_2$. Angles $\theta$, $\phi$ and $\beta$ are very  small. The deflection is given by

$$\tag{2.1.1} \alpha = \frac{4GM}{c^2} \frac{1}{\xi}$$
