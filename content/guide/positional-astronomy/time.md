## Sidereal Time

The local sidereal time is defined as the hour angle of vernal equinox ♈︎.

$$\text{LST} = \text{HA}$$

If the hour angle and right ascension of some object $X$ are known, the local sidereal time can be calculated as

$$\text{LST} = \text{HA}_X + \text{RA}_X$$

where $\text{HA}_X$ is the hour angle of object $X$ and $\text{RA}_X$ is the right ascension of object $X$.

The position of the vernal equinox ♈︎ changes over time due to precession and nutation. The equinoxes move backwards with time, the steady mean backward motion termed general precession. If nutation variations are ignored, the position of ♈︎ at any time defined the mean sidereal time (MST). If nutational variations are included, the position of ♈︎ at any time defines the apparent sidereal time (AST). The equation of equinoxes is defined as

$$ \mathcal{E} = \text{AST} - \text{MST} $$

It fluctuates around $-1^s$.

The time between transits of a celestial object over the Greenwich meridian and the local observer's meridian defines the longitude of the observer. The hour angle of an object as seen from the Greenwich meridian is the Greenwich hour angle (GHA). Similary, the Greenwich sidereal time (GST) is defined as the hour angle of the vernal equinox ♈︎ as seen from the Greenwich meridian. For an observer at longitude $\lambda$ (taken positive westwards),

$$\text{GST} = \text{LST} + \lambda$$
$$\boxed{\text{GHA}_X = \text{HA}_X + \lambda}$$

The sidereal day stars when ♈︎ transits across the observer's meridian and lasts 24 sidereal hours, until ♈︎ transists the meridian again.

## Mean and True Solar Time

One apparent solar day is the time between successive passages of the sun across observer's meridian. Its length varies through the year due to Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit.

To overcome this, we define the mean sun as a fictitious body, which moves along the celestial equator in the direction of increasing RA at a constant angular velocity equal to the mean angular velocity of the real sun. The time between successive passages of the mean sun over the observer's meridian is called mean solar day.

A fictitious body called the dynamical mean sun starts off from the perigee with the sun, moves along the ecliptic with angular velocity equal to the sun's mean angular velocity and returns to the perigee at the same time as the sun. When the dynamical mean sun reaches the vernal equinox ♈︎, the mean sun starts off along the celestial equator, returning to ♈︎ at the same time as the dynamical mean sun.

The equation of time is defined as the difference between the apparent solar time and the mean solar time, or the difference between the time of passage of the sun and the mean sun over the observer's meridian.

$$ \mathcal{E} = \text{HA}_\odot - \text{HA}_{MS} $$

When hour angle of mean sun is zero, it is said to be mean noon. When the hour angle of the true sun is zero, it is said to be solar noon. The time difference between the two is called the equation of time.

$$\text{LST} = \text{HA}_\odot + \text{RA}_\odot = \text{HA}_{MS} + \text{RA}_{MS}$$

Hence the equation of time can also be expressed as $\mathcal{E} = \text{RA}_{MS} - \text{RA}_\odot$.

We define Greenwich mean time (GMT) or universal time (UT) as

$$\boxed{\text{GMT} = \text{GHA}_{MS} + 12^h = \text{GHA}_\odot - \mathcal{E} + 12^h}$$

Thus the GMT at solar noon at Greenwich is

$$\text{GMT}_{\odot , G} = 12^h - \mathcal{E}$$

Readings in sidereal time and mean solar time can be interconverted by scaling with appropriate factors:

$$\text{LST} = \text{MST} \cdot \frac{366.2422}{365.2422}$$

Thus one sidereal day is approximately $23^h 56^m 4.1^s$ in mean solar time.
