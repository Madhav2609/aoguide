## Exam-wise Preparation

### NSEA

The National Standard Examination in Astronomy (NSEA) is the first stage of Astronomy Olympiad in India. It is conducted by the Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT) and serves as a qualifying examination for the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad.

To prepare for NSEA, I recommend the following resources:

- Concepts of Physics by H.C. Verma
- NCERT Class 11 and 12 Mathematics textbooks
- Schaum's Outline

Focus more on physics and mathematics, as two-thirds of the questions asked will be solely from physics and mathematics, and the remaining one-third will be from astronomy. I won't recommend focusing much on astronomy, as the syllabus is not well-defined and the questions are often based on physics and mathematics concepts, and can be solved without any prior knowledge of astronomy.

Some of the questions however, may require some knowledge of astronomy. For that, I recommend going through the following parts of this guide:

- [Pogson's Equation](photometry/magnitude/#pogsons-equation)
- [Bohr's Model](photometry/radiation-mechanism/#bohrs-model-of-the-atom)
- [Focal Length, Aperture, Magnification and Resolving Power](photometry/detectors.md)
- [Redshift and Hubble's Law](galactic-extragalactic-astrophysics/universe.md)

Again, I recommend focusing more on physics and mathematics, as most of the questions can be solved using those concepts. The above parts of the guide are just to help you get started with astronomy.

Aside from this, I recommend going through all the past year question papers of NSEA, which can be found on the IAPT website. This will give you an idea of the type of questions asked and help you prepare better.

### INAO

The Indian National Astronomy Olympiad (INAO) is the second stage of Astronomy Olympiad in India. It is conducted by Homie Bhabha Center for Science Education (HBCSE) and serves as a qualifying examination for the Astronomy Orientation-cum-Selection Camp (OCSC).

For INAO, I recommend going through most of the guide, except a few parts which are not relevant for INAO. The guide covers all of the astronomy knowledge required for INAO, and also includes some advanced topics that may not be covered in the syllabus, but are useful for understanding the concepts better.

I personally read the following books to prepare for INAO in 2024:

- Fundamentals of Astronomy by H. Karttunen and et al.
- Astronomy: Principles and Practice by A. E. Roy and D. Clarke

Aside from astronomy, a good level of physics and mathematics knowledge is also required for INAO. Further, go through the past year question papers of INAO, which can be found on the [HBCSE website](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-prepare/past-papers/).

### OCSC

For the Astronomy Orientation-cum-Selection Camp (OCSC), I recommend going through the complete guide, as it covers all the topics required for OCSC. The questions asked in OCSC are much more advanced than those asked in INAO, and require a good understanding of the concepts. I won't share anything specific here, as the guide is already well-structured and covers all the topics required for OCSC.

### USAAAO First Round

The United States of America Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad (USAAAO) is an international astronomy olympiad held in the United States. The first round is an online examination that tests the knowledge of astronomy, physics, and mathematics.

For the first round of USAAAO, I mainly just solved all the past year question papers, which can be found on the [USAAAO website](https://usaaao.org/resources/past-exams/). The questions have significantly more focus on astronomy, and the level of difficulty is much higher than NSEA. Few questions also involve purely theoretical concepts, that have not been covered in the guide.

### NAC

The National Astronomy Challenge (NAC) is the national olympiad of astronomy in USA. To prepare for the NAC, I recommend going through the complete guide, as questions asked in NAC are often harder than those asked in IOAA, and require a good understanding of the concepts.

Of course, make sure to go through the past year question papers of NAC, which can be found on the [USAAAO website](https://usaaao.org/resources/past-exams/).
