<div class="section-title">About AO Guide</div>

Hey there! We're excited you're here. AO Guide isn't just another textbook or study resource â€“ it's something we built because we genuinely felt frustrated with what was out there.

When we were preparing for astronomy olympiads, we found ourselves jumping between massive textbooks (that had way more info than we needed), scattered PDFs from random websites, and outdated materials that didn't really capture what IOAA was all about. It was honestly pretty overwhelming.

<div class="subsection-title">What We're Actually Trying to Do</div>

We wanted to create something that we wish we had when we started our olympiad journey:

1. **Everything you actually need** for IOAA â€“ no more, no less. We've been through this, so we know what matters.
2. **Built the way we learn** â€“ step by step, with plenty of examples and explanations that actually make sense.
3. **Modern and accessible** â€“ because studying shouldn't feel like punishment, and everyone deserves good resources.
4. **Visual and engaging** â€“ diagrams, animations, and interactive elements that help concepts click.
5. **Real problem-solving practice** â€“ not just theory, but the kind of problems you'll actually face in competitions.

<div class="subsection-title">Why This Exists (The Real Story)</div>

Look, astronomy and astrophysics are incredible subjects that got us hooked in the first place. But finding good study materials for olympiad prep? That was a nightmare. Most textbooks either assumed you already had a PhD or were so basic they weren't helpful for competition level.

We kept thinking: "There has to be a better way to learn this stuff." So we decided to make it ourselves.

Olympiad success isn't about memorizing formulas (though you need those too). It's about really understanding how things work, being able to think through problems step by step, and having the confidence to tackle something you've never seen before. That's what we're trying to help you build.

    <p><strong>Founder & Main Writer</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a high school student who somehow made it onto India's IOAA 2025 team. I love physics and math, but more importantly, I love figuring out how to explain complicated things in ways that actually make sense. When I'm not working on this guide, you'll probably find me solving random physics problems or trying to convince my friends that astronomy is the coolest subject ever.</p>

    <p>I'm also a high school student and was lucky enough to get into PROMYS 2025. I'm passionate about mathematics, physics, literature, and philosophy (yeah, I know, pretty random combo). I help make sure our math is rock-solid and our explanations are crystal clear. I believe that if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough â€“ so that's what we aim for.</p>
