Stars, galaxies, planets, and even you - everything in the universe emits some sort of radiation. This radiation can be in the form of electromagnetic radiation, such as light, or particles, such as electrons and protons. The study of this radiation is called radiometry. Here, we will be studying about electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a wave in the electric and magnetic fields, which propagate through space, carrying energy and momentum. These waves can be characterized by a wavelength and frequency. Radiation with wavelength lying in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (400 to 700 nm) is called light.

A surface which emits radiation isotropically (symmetrically in all directions) is called a Lambertian surface.

## Flux

What is flux? Flux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel through a surface or substance. Here, the term flux density $F$ (flux and flux density are often used interchangeably without much thought, even though they're two different things) is the amount of radiant energy (energy carried by the radiation) passing through a unit area per unit time. The units of flux density are $\mathrm{W \, m^{-2}}$. Flux density is also called irradiance.

In astrophysics, we often have to deal with how much energy is being recieved by our telescopes from a star or any other astronomical object. This is where flux becomes important. For example, the flux density of Sun's radiation on earth is called the solar constant, which is about $1365 \mathrm{\, W \, m^{-2}}$.

If a surface receives power $P$ from radiation, at an angle $\theta$ to the normal, the flux density $F$ is given by

$$F = \frac{P}{A} \cos \theta$$

where $A$ is the area of the surface. The factor $\cos \theta$ accounts for the fact that the radiation is not perpendicular to the surface. The flux density is maximum when $\theta = 0$, i.e., when the radiation is perpendicular to the surface.

Now we will define some more useful quantities related to the flow of radiation.

Assume we have some radiation passing through a surface element $dA$. Some of the radiation will leave $dA$ within a solid angle $d \omega$; the angle between $d \omega$ (the direction of outgoing radiation) and the normal to the surface is denoted by $\theta$. The amount of energy with frequency in the range [$\nu$, $\nu + d\nu$] entering this solid angle in time $dt$ is

$$\tag{2.1.1} dE_\nu = B_\nu \cos \theta \, dA \, d\nu \, d\omega \, dt$$

Here the quantity $B_\nu$ is called the spectral radiance of the radiation at frequency $\nu$ and direction $\theta$. The total radiance is given by

$$\tag{2.1.2} B = \int_0^{\infty} B_\nu \, d\nu $$

The spectral flux density $F_\nu$ is the flux density of the radiation in the frequency range [$\nu$, $\nu + d\nu$]. This tells us how much flux is carried by radiation per unit frequency. In radio astronomy, spectral flux densities are often measured in Janskys. The flux density is related to the spectral radiance as

$$\tag{2.1.3} F_\nu = \int_\Omega B_\nu \cos \theta \, d\omega $$
$$\tag{2.1.4} F = \int_\Omega B \cos \theta \, d\omega $$

The integral is carried over the solid angle $\Omega$ through which the flux density is being calculated.

For isotropic radiation, the flux density leaving a spherical surface of radius $r$ is given by

$$F = \int_S B \cos \theta \, d\omega = \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{2\pi} B \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\theta \,  d\phi$$
$$\tag{2.1.5}  \implies \boxed{F = \pi B}$$

Flux $L$ is defined as the power going through some surface, and is measured in units of $\mathrm{W}$. The flux emitted by a star (power emitted by the star) into a solid angle $\omega$ is $L = \omega r^2 F$, where $F$ is the flux density at a distance $r$. The total flux passing through a closed surface surrounding the source is known as the luminosity $L$. If the source radiates isotropically, $L = 4\pi r^2 F$. The luminosity does not depend on the distance; this gives that the flux density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

For extended objects, surface brightness $B$ is defined as the flux density per unit solid angle. Here, the observer views an extended source and is located at the vertex of the solid angle subtended by the object.

$$\tag{2.1.6} B = \frac{F}{\omega}$$

Surface brightness is independent of distance. It is equal to radiance of the object if the object emits isotropically.

The energy of radiation is quantized in packets called photons. The energy of a photon is given by

$$\tag{2.1.7} E = h \nu$$

where $\nu$ is the frequency of the radiation. The momentum carried by a photon is given by

$$\tag{2.1.8} p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{h \nu}{c}$$

The energy density of radiation (measured in units of $\mathrm{J \, m^{-3}}$) is the amount of energy per unit volume, given by

$$\tag{2.1.9} u = \frac{1}{c} \int_\Omega B \, {d \omega} $$

where $B$ is the radiance of the radiation.

For an isotropic source, $u = \frac{4 \pi}{c} B$.

The radiation pressure (measured in units of $\mathrm{Pa}$) is the force per unit area exerted by radiation on a surface. It is given by

$$ P = \frac{1}{c} \int_S B \cos \theta \, {d \omega} $$

This shows that radiation can exert measurable forces, especially significant in stellar interiors or solar sails. For an isotropic source, $P = \frac{1}{3} u$. The radiation pressure is equal to the momentum flux density of the radiation.

## Blackbody radiation

A blackbody is an object that does not reflect or scatter any radiation falling on it, but absorbs all the radiation falling on it completely. It emits radiation evenly in all directions and at all wavelengths. Kirchoff's definition of a blackbody is an ideal body that neither reflects any light nor allows it to pass through. The emissivity $\epsilon$ of a body is defined as the ratio of the radiation emitted by the body to the radiation emitted by a blackbody of the same shape at the same temperature. The emissivity of a blackbody is 1, while that of a perfect reflector is 0. The emissivity of a real body lies between 0 and 1.

$$\tag{2.1.10} \epsilon = \frac{B}{B_\text{blackbody}}$$

where $B$ is the radiance of the body and $B_\text{blackbody}$ is the radiance of a blackbody at the same temperature.

Kirchoff's law states that the emissivity of a body is equal to its absorptivity $a$. This means that a good absorber is also a good emitter. So, a perfect absorber (like a blackbody) is also a perfect emitter.

Examples of blackbodies include stars (which closely approximate blackbody spectra), the cosmic microwave background (a nearly perfect blackbody from the early universe), and laboratory setups like a cavity with a small hole that traps radiation.

The radiation emitted by a blackbody only depends on its temperature, and follows Planck's law. Planck's law describes how the light from a blackbody is spread across different wavelengths or frequencies, depending only on its temperature. The spectral radiance of a blackbody at temperature $T$ is given by

$$
\tag{2.1.11} \boxed{
    \begin{aligned}
        B_\nu(T) &= \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu / kT} - 1} \\
        B_\lambda(T) &= \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{h c / \lambda k T} - 1} \\
    \end{aligned}
}
$$

These two are connected by the relation $B_\nu(T) \, d\nu = -B_\lambda(T) \, d\lambda$ (the minus sign comes from the fact that as frequency increases, wavelength decreases.).

The total radiance is the spectral radiance integrated over all frequencies. It is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
B(T) &= \int_0^{\infty} B_\nu(T) \, d\nu \\
&= \frac{2 \pi^4 k^4}{15 h^3 c^2} T^4 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This gives

$$\tag{2.1.12} \boxed{B(T) = \frac{\sigma}{\pi} \, T^4}$$

Here we have defined a new constant - called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant as

$$\tag{2.1.13} \sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 k^4}{15 h^3 c^2}$$

It is numerically equal to $\sigma \approx 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2} \, K^{-4}}$.

{{< callout emoji="🧮" >}}
The integral can be carried out as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^{\infty} B_\nu(T) \, d\nu &= \frac{2 h}{c^2} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\nu^3}{e^{h\nu / kT} - 1} \, d\nu \\
&= \frac{2 h}{c^2} \left( \frac{kT}{h} \right)^4 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \, dx \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The integral $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}$ is a standard result in mathematics. For the more curious readers, the result can be derived using the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ and the gamma function $\Gamma(s)$. We can use the following relation:

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(s) \zeta(s)$$

For $s=4$, we have $\Gamma(4) = 6$ and $\zeta(4) = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$. Hence,

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(4) \zeta(4) = 6 \cdot \frac{\pi^4}{90} = \frac{\pi^4}{15}$$

This gives the result

$$\int_0^{\infty} B_\nu(T) \, d\nu = \frac{2 h}{c^2} \left( \frac{kT}{h} \right)^4 \cdot \frac{\pi^4}{15} = \frac{2 \pi^4 k^4}{15 h^3 c^2} T^4$$

{{< /callout >}}

The flux density for an isotropic source is given by (using eq 2.1.5)

$$\tag{2.1.14} F(T) = \pi B(T) = \sigma T^4$$

This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

If the radius of a star is $R$ and its temperature is $T$, then its luminosity is given by

$$\tag{2.1.15} L = 4 \pi R^2 F = 4 \pi^2 R^2 B = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4$$

The spectral luminosity is defined as $L_\lambda = 4 \pi^2 R^2 B_\lambda$. The spectral flux density at a distance $r$ is given by

$$\tag{2.1.16} F_\lambda = \frac{L_\lambda}{4\pi r^2} = \pi B_\lambda \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2 $$

Hotter objects emit more at higher energies (higher frequencies and lower wavelengths). This can be quantified by Wein's law, which relates the peak wavelength and frequency (wavelength or frequency corresponding to the mode energy of the radiated photons; the wavelength or frequency at which the blackbody emits the most) of the blackbody spectrum to the temperature of the object. The peak of the blackbody spectrum shifts with temperature, and this is described by Wien's displacement law. The wavelength corresponding to the peak of the blackbody spectrum is given by

$$\frac{d}{d\lambda} B_\lambda(T) = 0$$

This gives the relation

$$\tag{2.1.17} \boxed{\lambda_\text{peak} T = b_\lambda}$$

Thus $B_\lambda$ peaks at the energy

$$\tag{2.1.18} E \approx 4.965 \,kT $$

{{< callout emoji="🧮" >}}

Taking the derivative $\frac{d}{d\lambda} B_\lambda (T)$ and defining $x = \frac{hc}{\lambda kT}$, after some algebra we get

$$\frac{x e^x}{e^x - 1} = 5$$

This equation can be solved using the Lambert W function, which gives the solution for $x$ as $x = 5 + W_0(-5 e^{-5}) \approx 4.965$. This gives the value of $b_\lambda = \frac{hc}{kx} \approx 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{\, m \, K}$.

The peak energy can be calculated using the relation $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = xkT \approx 4.965 \,kT$.

{{< /callout >}}

The frequency corresponding to the peak of the blackbody spectrum is given by

$$\frac{d}{d\nu} B_\nu(T) = 0$$

This gives the relation

$$\tag{2.1.19} \boxed{\nu_\text{peak} / T = b_\nu}$$

Thus $B_\nu$ peaks at the energy

$$\tag{2.1.20} E \approx 2.821 \,kT $$

{{< callout emoji="🧮" >}}

Taking the derivative $\frac{d}{d\nu} B_\nu (T)$ and defining $y = \frac{h\nu}{kT}$, after some algebra we get

$$\frac{y e^y}{e^y - 1} = 3$$

This gives $y = 3 + W_0(-3 e^{-3}) \approx 2.821$. This gives the value of $b_\nu = \frac{ky}{h} \approx 5.879 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{\, Hz \, K}$.

The peak energy can be calculated using the relation $E = h \nu = ykT \approx 2.821 \,kT$.

{{< /callout >}}

The reason eq 2.1.18 and 2.1.20 are different is because the peak of the spectrum is not at the same energy for both $\lambda$ and $\nu$. One cannot go from $B_\nu$ to $B_\lambda$ by simply changing the variable. One also needs to multiply by $|d\nu / d\lambda| = c /\lambda^2$, which shifts the peak of the distribution to higher energies. These peaks are the mode energy of a photon.

Equation 2.1.17 and 2.1.19 are together known as Wien's displacement law.

When $\lambda \gg \lambda_\text{peak}$ or $\nu \ll \nu_\text{peak}$, we can use the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to get

$$\tag{2.1.21} B_\nu(T) \approx \frac{2 \nu^2 kT}{c^2}$$
$$\tag{2.1.22} B_\lambda(T) \approx \frac{2c kT}{\lambda^4}$$

The Rayleigh-Jeans approximation is used often in radio astronomy, where the wavelengths are much larger than the peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum.

When $\lambda \approx \lambda_\text{peak}$ or $\nu \approx \nu_\text{peak}$, we can use the Wein approximation to get

$$\tag{2.1.23} B_\nu(T) \approx \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} e^{-h\nu / kT}$$
$$\tag{2.1.24} B_\lambda(T) \approx \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} e^{-h c / \lambda k T}$$

The energy density of blackbody radiation is given by

$$\tag{2.1.25} u(T) = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{4 \pi}{c} B_\nu(T) \, d\nu = \frac{4 \sigma}{c} T^4 = aT^4$$

where $a \approx 7.566 \times 10^{-16} \, \mathrm{J \, m^{-3} \, K^{-4}}$ is the radiation constant. The radiation pressure is given by

$$\tag{2.1.26} P = \frac{1}{3} u = \frac{1}{3} a T^4 $$

As stated earlier, energy comes in quantized packets called photons. The number density of photons emitted by a blackbody at temperature $T$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
n(T) &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{u_\nu(T)}{h \nu} \, d\nu \\
&= \frac{16 \pi k^3 \zeta(3)}{h^3 c^3} T^3 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence,

$$\tag{2.1.27} n(T) = \beta \, T^3$$

where $\beta \approx 2.03 \times 10^7 \mathrm{m^{-3} K^{-3}}$.

{{< callout emoji="🧮" >}}
The integral can be carried out as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{u_\nu(T)}{h \nu} \, d\nu &= \frac{2}{c^2} \frac{4 \pi}{c} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\nu^2}{e^{h\nu / kT} - 1} \, d\nu \\
&= \frac{2}{c^2} \frac{4 \pi}{c} \left( \frac{kT}{h} \right)^3 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} \, dx \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the previously stated relation

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(s) \zeta(s)$$

For $s=3$, we have $\Gamma(3) = 2$. This gives the result

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{u_\nu(T)}{h \nu} \, d\nu = \frac{2}{c^2} \frac{4 \pi}{c} \left( \frac{kT}{h} \right)^3 \cdot 2 \zeta(3) = \frac{16 \pi k^3 \zeta(3)}{h^3 c^3} T^3$$

{{< /callout >}}

The mean energy of the photons emitted by the blackbody is

$$\tag{2.1.28} \langle E \rangle = \frac{u(T)}{n(T)} = \frac{\pi^4}{30 \zeta(3)} kT \approx 2.70 \, kT$$

## Temperature

The temperature of a star can be defined in several ways.

- The effective temperature $T_e$ is defined as the temperature of a blackbody which radiates the same total luminosity as the star. For example, the Sun has a luminosity of $3.846 \times 10^{26} \, \mathrm{W}$ and a radius of $6.96 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m}$. The effective temperature of the Sun is given by

$$ T_e = \left( \frac{L}{4 \pi \sigma R^2} \right)^{1/4} \approx 5778 \mathrm{\, K}$$

- If we assume at some wavelength $\lambda$ the spectral flux density $F_\lambda$ at the surface of the star is given by Planck's law, we get the brightness temperature $T_b$. This is the temperature of a blackbody that matches the brightness of the star at that specific wavelength. Since stars are not ideal blackbodies, $T_b$ depends on the wavelength used.

- The temperature giving the best fit for Planck's law in a wavelength range is the color temperature $T_c$ of the object.
