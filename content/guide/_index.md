Welcome to the AO Guide! To navigate the guide, use the sidebar on the left. You can also search for topics using the search bar at the top right. A table containing all useful constants is provided on the rightmost tab of the top bar.

## How to start your journey

If you're just beginning, the following order is recommended:

1. **Positional Astronomy**: Start with the basics of celestial coordinates, timekeeping, and the motion of celestial objects.
2. **Photometry**: Learn about the tools and techniques used to measure the brightness of celestial objects.
3. **Celestial Mechanics**: Understand the laws governing the motion of celestial bodies.
4. **Stellar Physics**: Explore the physics of stars, including their structure and evolution.
5. **Galactic & Extragalactic Astrophysics**: Study the large-scale structure of the universe, including galaxies and clusters, along with cosmology.

For those of you who are already familiar with the basics, feel free to jump to any chapter that interests you. Each chapter is designed to be self-contained, so you can learn at your own pace.

## How the Guide is structured

The guide is structured in a way that allows you to start from the basics and gradually build up your knowledge. It has been divided into 5 units, each unit having several chapters, with each chapter covering a specific topic in detail. The chapters are further divided into sections for easier navigation.

To make the guide more interactive, we have included several diagrams and illustrations to help you visualize the concepts being discussed. Additionally, we have included links to external resources for further reading. Eye-catching callout boxes are used to highlight important points, tips, and additional information. Here are the different types of callout boxes used in the guide:

<br/>

{{< callout type="remark" >}}
This is a remark callout box. It is used to convey additional information or clarify a point made in the main text.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="image" >}}
This is an image callout box. It is used to display images or diagrams that are relevant to the topic being discussed.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="trivia" >}}
This is a trivia callout box. It contains interesting facts or historical context related to the topic.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="math" >}}
This is a math callout box. It shows complex mathematical derivations require to arrive at an equation.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="table" >}}
This is a table callout box. It is used to present data or information in a tabular format.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="why" >}}
This is a why callout box. It goes into explanation of a non-trivial concept or fact mentioned in the main text.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="DIY" >}}
This is a DIY callout box. It contains exercises or problems for the reader to solve, encouraging active engagement with the material.
{{< /callout >}}

<br/>

Every chapter contains in-text problems, as well as problems at the end of the chapter. These problems are designed to test your understanding of the concepts covered in the chapter (They can be hard, so don't be discouraged if you find them challenging!). The solutions to these problems are presented in the solutions tab of the problem box.

{{< tabs >}}
    {{< tab name="P1" >}}
    What to do if I get stuck on a problem?
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab name="Solution" >}}
    Ask for ideas on our discord server!

## Prerequisites

The guide assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of high school level mathematics and physics. Familiarity with calculus and basic mechanics is required. We have tried to keep the guide mathematically rigorous, however, we have made sure all necessary concepts are explained in detail.
