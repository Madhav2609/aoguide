## Nature of Radiation

The quanta of electromagnetic radiation is a photon, whose energy is given by $E = h \nu$ where $\nu$ is the frequency of the photon.

Atomic transitions give rise to line spectrum. Hot gases under low pressure produce an emission spectrum. If cold gas is used and observed against a white light, the same lines are seen as absorption lines.

If an electron bound to an atom, having energy $E < 0$ is given energy more than $|E|$, it will leave the atom. This is called a bound-free transition. The inverse process of capturing a free electron is called recombination or free-bound transition.

When an electron scatters from a nucleus or ion without being captured, the radiation emitted is called free-free radiation. In very hot gases, this is the most important form of radiation, and is called thermal bremsstrahlung. The absorption process can be called a bound-bound transition.

Electromagnetic radiation can be polarished - linearly, circularly or elliptically. For a partially linearly polarised beam, the degree of polarisation is defined as

$$ P = \frac{I_{\text{max}} - I_{\text{min}}}{I_{\text{max}} + I_{\text{min}}} $$

where $I_\text{max}$ and $I_\text{min}$ are the maximum and minimum intensities of the beam.

Scattering is an absorption followed by an instantaneous emission at the same wavelength but in a new direction.

Electric fields broaden spectral lines. This is called the Stark effect. The magnetic field also causes broadening of spectral lines, called the Zeeman effect.

A free charge in accelerated motion emits radiation, called synchrotron radiation.

## Bohr's Model of the Atom

Bohr's first postulate states that angular momentum of an electron must be a multiple of $\hbar$.

$$ mvr = n \hbar $$

where $n = 1,2,3, \ldots$ is called the principal quantum number.

The total energy of an electron in the $n^\text{th}$ orbit is

$$\tag{2.1.22} E_n = - \frac{m_e e^4 Z^2}{32 \pi^2 \varepsilon_0^2 \hbar^2 n^2} = - E_0 \frac{Z^2}{n^2} $$

During a transition from the $n_i^\text{th}$ to $n_f^\text{th}$ orbit, the energy of the photon emitted is given by

$$\tag{2.1.23} E = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} = E_0 Z^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$

Thus the wavelength of the photon is

$$\tag{2.1.24} \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{E_0 Z^2}{hc} \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) = RZ^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$

The spectral lines of hydrogen can be classified into series, based on the final state of the electron. The series are:

- Lyman series: $n_f = 1$. These lie in the ultraviolet range.
- Balmer series: $n_f = 2$. These lies in the visible range.
- Paschen series: $n_f = 3$. These lies in the infrared range.
- Brackett series: $n_f = 4$. These lies in the infrared range.
- Pfund series: $n_f = 5$. These lies in the infrared range.
- Humphreys series: $n_f = 6$. These lies in the infrared range.
