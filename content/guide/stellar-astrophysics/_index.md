Stellar Physics is the branch of astrophysics that studies the physical and chemical properties of stars, including their formation, evolution, and eventual fate. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from the nuclear processes that power stars to the effects of stellar winds and magnetic fields. Stellar astrophysics is crucial for understanding the lifecycle of stars, which in turn influences the chemical evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.

In this unit, we will cover:

- Stellar structure and nucleosynthesis
- Stellar classification and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
- Stellar evolution and the life cycle of stars
- Our solar system and the Sun's properties
- Stellar remnants: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes
