Astronomy can be classified into several subfields, each of which focuses on different aspects of the universe. Some of the main subfields of astronomy include:

- **Astrophysics**: The study of the physical properties and behavior of celestial objects and phenomena.
- **Cosmology**: The study of the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe as a whole.
- **Planetary Science**: The study of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies within our solar system and beyond.
- **Stellar Astronomy**: The study of stars, their formation, evolution, and death.
- **Galactic Astronomy**: The study of galaxies, their formation, structure, and evolution.

## What is an Astronomy Olympiad?

An astronomy olympiad is a competitive event that tests participants' knowledge and skills in astronomy. It typically involves solving problems, conducting experiments, and answering questions related to various aspects of astronomy. The olympiad format may vary, but it often includes theoretical and practical components, such as observational tasks and data analysis.
Astronomy olympiads are designed to challenge participants and encourage them to explore the wonders of the universe. They provide an opportunity for students to showcase their knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking skills in a competitive environment. Participants may come from various educational backgrounds, including high school and university students.
Astronomy olympiads are typically organized at national and international levels, with participants competing for medals, scholarships, and recognition. The most prestegious international olympiad for astronomy is the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA). These events bring together talented students from around the world to share their passion for astronomy and engage in friendly competition.
