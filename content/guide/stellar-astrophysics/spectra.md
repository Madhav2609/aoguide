The light coming from a star can be analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum, composed of a continuous spectra superimposed with narrow spectral lines. Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule, with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. Stars can be classified into various classes, depending on their spectra.

## Harvard Classification

The Harvard classification is based on lines that are mainly sensitive to the stellar temperature, rather than to gravity or luminosity. Important lines are the hydrogen Balmer lines, the lines of neutral helium, the iron lines, the H and K doublet of ionised calcium at 396.8 and 393.3 nm, the G band due to the CH molecule and some metals around 431 nm, the neutral calcium line at 422.7 nm and the lines of titanium oxide (TiO). The main types in the Harvard classification are denoted by capital letters.

|Class |$T_\text{e}$ ($\small{K}$)|Color|M ($\small{M_\odot}$)|R ($\small{R_\odot}$)|L ($\small{L_\odot}$)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|O|$\ge$ 33000|Blue|$\ge$ 16|$\ge$ 6.6|$\ge$ 30000|
|B|10000 - 33000|Deep bluish white|2.1-16|1.8-6.6|25-30000|
|A|7300-10000|Bluish white|1.4-2.1|1.4-1.8|5-25|
|F|6000-7300|White|1.04-1.4|1.15-1.4|1.5-5|
|G|5300-6000|Yellowish white|0.8-1.04|0.96-1.15|0.6-1.5|
|K|3900-5300|Pale yellowish orange|0.45-0.8|0.7-0.96|0.08-0.6|
|M|2300-3900|Orangish red|0.08-0.45|$\le$ 0.7|$\le$ 0.08|

The mass (M), radius (R) and luminosity (L) ranges are only for main-sequence stars. A common mnemonic to remember the class names is 'Oh Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me'.

Additional classes include

- W/WR: Wolf-Rayet stars
- P: Planetary nebulae
- C and S: Parallel branches to types G-M, differeing in their surface compostion
- L, T and Y: Red and brown dwarfs

These spectral classes can be further divided into subclasses, denoted by numbers 0 to 9. 0 is the hottest star in that spectral class, while 9 is the coolest. The spectral class of the Sun in G2.

## MK classification

The Morgan-Keenana or Yerkes classification further distinguishes and classifies stars based on their luminosity

- 0 or Ia$^+$: hypergiants or extremely luminous supergiants
- Ia: luminous supergiants
- Iab: intermediate-size luminous supergiants
- Ib: less luminous supergiants
- II: bright giants
- III: normal giants
- IV: subgiants
- V: main-sequence stars (dwarfs)
- sd or VI: subdwarfs
- D or VII: white dwarfs

The sun is a G2V type star.

## Peculiar stars

The spectra of some stars differ from what one would expect on the basis of their temperature and luminosity. Such stars are called peculiar. These include

- Wolf Rayet stars are very hot stars. The spectra of Wolf– Rayet stars have broad emission lines of hydrogen and ionised helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. There are hardly any absorption lines. The Wolf–Rayet stars are thought to be very massive stars that have lost their outer layers in a strong stellar wind. This has exposed the stellar interior, which gives rise to a different spectrum than the normal outer layers.
- In some O and B stars the hydrogen absorption lines have weak emission components either at the line centre or in its wings. These stars are called Be and shell stars (the letter e after the spectral type indicates that there are emission lines in the spectrum). The emission lines are formed in a rotationally flattened gas shell around the star. The shell and Be stars show irregular variations, apparently related to structural changes in the shell.
- The strongest emission lines are those of the P Cygni stars, which have one or more sharp absorption lines on the short wavelength side of the emission line. It is thought that the lines are formed in a thick expanding envelope. The P Cygni stars are often variable.
- The peculiar A stars or Ap stars (p = peculiar) are usually strongly magnetic stars, where the lines are split into several components by the Zeeman effect. The lines of certain elements, such as magnesium, silicon, europium, chromium and strontium, are exceptionally strong in the Ap stars. Lines of rarer elements such as mercury, gallium or krypton may also be present. Otherwise, the Ap stars are like normal main sequence stars.
- The Am stars (m = metallic) also have anomalous element abundances, but not to the same extent as the Ap stars. The lines of e.g. the rare earths and the heaviest elements are strong in their spectra; those of calcium and scandium are weak.
- In the S stars, the normal lines of titanium, scandium and vanadium oxide are replaced with oxides of heavier elements, zirconium, yttrium and barium. A large fraction of the S stars are irregular variables. The name of the C stars refers to carbon. The metal oxide lines are almost completely absent in their spectra; instead, various carbon compounds ($\small{\ce{CN}}$, $\small{\ce{C2}}$, $\small{\ce{CH}}$) are strong. The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen is 4–5 times greater in the C stars than in normal stars. The C stars are divided into two groups, hotter R stars and cooler N stars.
- Another type of giant stars with abundance anomalies are the barium stars. The lines of barium, strontium, rare earths and some carbon compounds are strong in their spectra. Apparently nuclear reaction products have been mixed up to the surface in these stars.

## Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram

The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or HR diagram is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities and their stellar classifications or effective temperatures.

The empirical mass-luminosity relation states

$$
\begin{aligned}
&L \approx 0.23 \: M^{2.3} &\qquad \qquad (M < 0.43)&\\
&L \approx M^{4} &\qquad \qquad (0.43 < M < 2)&\\
&L \approx 1.4 \: M^{3.5} &\qquad \qquad (2 < M < 55) &\qquad \qquad (\text{Main Sequence})\\
&L \approx 32000 \: M &\qquad \qquad (M > 55)&

where the luminosity and mass are measured in $L_\odot$ and $M_\odot$ respectively.
