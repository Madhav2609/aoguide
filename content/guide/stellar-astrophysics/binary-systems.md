## Roche Lobe

Roche lobe is the region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. It is an approximately teardrop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential, with the apex of the teardrop pointing towards the other star star (the apex is at the $L_1$ Lagrangian point of the system).

Close to each star, surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately spherical and concentric with the nearer star. Far from the stellar system, the equipotentials are approximately ellipsoidal and elongated parallel to the axis joining the stellar centers. A critical equipotential intersects itself at the $L_1$ Lagrangian point of the system, forming a two-lobed figure-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe. These lobes are called Roche lobes.

$L_1$ is the gravitational capture equilibrium point. It is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system. It is at the lowest potential of all Lagrange points. When a star "exceeds its Roche lobe", its surface extends out beyond its Roche lobe and the material which lies outside the Roche lobe can "fall off" into the other object's Roche lobe via the first Lagrangian point. In binary evolution this is referred to as mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow.

Consider a binary system with two stars of masses $M_1$ and $M_2$, having orbital separation $a$. Approximation of the lobe (of $M_1$) as a sphere of radius $r_1$ with mass ratio $q = M_1 / M_2$ is given by the Eggleton formula:

$$\tag{5.2.1} \frac{r_1}{a} = \frac{0.49 q^{2/3}}{0.6q^{2/3} + \ln (1 + q^{1/3})} $$

## Jeans Limit

The Jeans instability describes an instability that leads to the gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas or dust. It causes the collapse of interstellar gas clouds and subsequent star formation. It occurs when the internal gas pressure is not strong enough to prevent the gravitational collapse of a region filled with matter.

Consider a gas cloud of mass $M$, radius $R$, uniform density $\rho$, mean molecular mass $\mu$ and temperature $T$. Jean's length is the critical radius of a gas cloud, below which the cloud will collapse under its own gravity. The gravitational force acting on the cloud is counteracted by the thermal pressure of the gas. The kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$ of the cloud is

$$ K = \frac{3}{2} N k T = 2kT \frac{\pi R^3 \rho}{\mu m_H} $$

$$ U = -\frac{3}{5} \frac{GM^2}{R} = -\frac{16}{15} G \pi^2 R^5 \rho^2 $$

Using virial theorem,

$$\tag{5.2.2} R = \lambda_J = \left( \frac{15}{4 \pi} \frac{k}{Gm_H} \frac{T}{\mu \rho} \right)^{1/2} $$

The critical mass, called Jean's mass is given by

$$\tag{5.2.3} M_J = \frac{4}{3} \pi \lambda_J^3 \rho = \sqrt{ \frac{375}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{k}{Gm_H} \right)^3 \frac{T^3}{\mu^3 \rho} } $$
