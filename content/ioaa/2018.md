    Read the statements given below and state if they are true or false:

    1. For some galaxies the apparent recession speed exceeds the speed of light.
    2. The velocity - Distance relation as given by Hubble cannot allow recession velocities to exceed the speed of light.
    3. Hubble-Lemaitre's law (formerly known as Hubble's Law) does not violate special relativity.
    4. If some galaxies would have an apparent recession speed exceeding the speed of light, then the photons from those galaxies can never reach us.
    5. As the expansion of Universe is accelerating, photons emitted right now from galaxies which have apparent recession speed equal to the speed of light will never reach us.

    1.  **True.** In an expanding universe, distant galaxies can appear to recede faster than the speed of light due to the expansion of space itself, not their motion through space. This is permitted by general relativity.
    2.  **False.** Correct relation: **False.** The original linear Hubble relation, $v = H_0 D$, where $v$ is recession velocity, $H_0$ is the Hubble constant, and $D$ is distance, implies that for large enough distances, $v$ can exceed the speed of light. This is an apparent velocity due to space expansion.
    3.  **True.** Hubble-Lemaitre's Law describes the expansion of space, which is a concept from General Relativity. Special Relativity applies to objects moving _through_ space, not the expansion of space itself.
    4.  **False.** Photons from galaxies receding faster than light can still reach us if the expansion rate between us and the galaxy decreases sufficiently over time, allowing the light to "catch up" as space expands less rapidly.
    5. **False.** Even with accelerating expansion, photons emitted from galaxies at the Hubble radius (where apparent recession speed equals the speed of light) can still reach us. However, photons from galaxies _beyond_ a certain cosmological horizon (event horizon) will never reach us if the acceleration continues indefinitely.

    An observer measured trigonometric parallaxes of stars in a star cluster. Due to random errors, the measured parallax values are distributed symmetrically around the expected value with standard deviation equal to $0.05$ mas (milliarcsec). Assume there are no systematic errors and assume all stars in the said cluster have the same luminosity. It is known that the distance of this cluster from us is $R=5$ kpc.

    He gave the data table to 4 of his students (A, B, C and D) and they estimated the distance to the cluster in the following ways:

    1.  A. Convert each parallax measurement into distance and then find the average distance $(R_{A})$
    2.  B. Take the average of all parallaxes first and then convert the average parallax into distance. $(R_{B})$
    3.  C. Convert each parallax measurement into distance and then take the median distance value. $(R_{C})$
    4.  D. Find the median value of the parallaxes and then convert the median value into distance. $(R_{D})$

    State if the following statements are true or false. In case a given mathematical relation is false, give the correct relation.

    1.  If the $i^{th}$ star gave the smallest value of parallax and the $j^{th}$ star gave the highest value of parallax, in all likelihood $R_{i}-R>R-R_{j}$
    2.  $R_{A}=R$ (i.e. there is a high chance that the distance estimated by A fairly matches the true distance)
    3.  $R_{B}=R$ (i.e. there is a high chance that the distance estimated by B fairly matches the true distance)
    4.  $R_{C}<R$ (i.e. there is a high chance that the distance estimated by C will be systematically lower than the true distance)
    5.  $R_{D}=R$ (i.e. there is a high chance that the distance estimated by D fairly matches the true distance)

    For parallaxes, we have a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu=0.2$ mas and standard deviation $\sigma=0.05$ mas. This means the standard deviation is 25% of the expectation value.

    1.  **True.** The relationship between parallax $(p)$ and distance $(d)$ is $d = 1/p$. This is an inverse relationship. If parallax values are symmetrically distributed, the distances will not be. Small parallaxes correspond to large distances, and large parallaxes correspond to small distances. Thus, a small error in parallax for a close star has a smaller impact on distance than the same error for a distant star.
    2.  **False.** Correct relation: $R_{A} > R$. Due to the inverse relationship $d=1/p$, converting each parallax to distance _before_ averaging tends to overestimate the true distance. Smaller parallaxes (larger distances) have a disproportionately large effect on the average.
    3.  **True.** Taking the average of parallaxes first $(p_{avg})$ and then converting to distance $(R_B = 1/p_{avg})$ tends to give a more accurate estimate of the true distance, especially when errors are symmetric around the true parallax.
    4.  **False.** Correct relation: $R_{C} = R$. Taking the median of distances $(R_C)$ is generally robust against extreme values. For a symmetrically distributed parallax, the median of distances will be a good estimator of the true distance.
    5. **True.** Finding the median value of parallaxes $(p_{median})$ and then converting it to distance $(R_D = 1/p_{median})$ should also provide a good estimate that matches the true distance, as the median is less sensitive to outliers.

    Consider sunrise at Beijing ($\varphi=40^{\circ}$) on the vernal equinox day.

    1.  Let us say $r_{l}$, $r_{d}$, $r_{t}$ and $r_{u}$ are distances from the centre of the undistorted disk of the Sun to the edge of the disk towards the directions left, down, right and up respectively.
    What will be the hierarchical relation $(<,=,>) $ between the four radii just after the sunrise?
    2.  What is the correction in the time of rise of the top edge of the disk as compared to the case without atmosphere?
    You may assume that typically atmospheric refraction near the horizon is $35^{\prime}$. Please only consider the apparent diurnal motion.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab >}}
    1.  $r_{d} < r_{u} < r_{l} = r_{t}$ <br>
    Atmospheric refraction bends light downwards. This makes celestial objects appear higher in the sky than they actually are. At sunrise, the Sun's lower limb is significantly lifted by refraction, while the upper limb is also lifted but by a lesser amount, distorting the disk into an oval shape. The horizontal edges are minimally affected by refraction. Thus, the apparent vertical diameter $(r_u + r_d)$ is compressed, making $r_d$ (downwards) appear smallest due to the strong refraction at the very horizon, followed by $r_u$ (upwards), while horizontal radii $(r_l, r_t)$ remain largely unchanged and appear largest.

    2.  When the upper edge of the Sun is under the horizon by $35^{\prime}$ (due to refraction), it appears on the horizon earlier. We need to calculate how long it takes for the Sun to move $35^{\prime}$ due to Earth's rotation.
        The Earth's apparent diurnal motion (angular speed) is:

        $$ \omega = \frac{360^{\circ}}{23^h56^m4^s} = \frac{21600^{\prime}}{1436.0682^m} \approx 15.0411^{\prime}/\text{min} $$

        The time correction $\Delta t$ is due to the apparent shift caused by refraction. For the top edge to appear at the horizon, when it would normally be $35^{\prime}$ below, the time difference is:

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \Delta t &= \frac{\text{Angular shift}}{\omega \cos\varphi} \\
                 &= \frac{35^{\prime}}{15.0411^{\prime}/\text{min} \times \cos(40^{\circ})} \\
                 &\approx 3.04 \text{ minutes}
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        So, the top edge rises approximately $3.04$ minutes earlier than it would without an atmosphere.

    Two friends wanted to measure the height of the hill next to their village ($\varphi=40^{\circ}$). One of the friends climbed to the top of the hill and she agreed to send a light signal to her friend in the village as soon as she sees the sunset. On March 21, when they did this experiment, the friend in village received the light signal $4.1$ minutes after the sunset from the village. Estimate the height of the hill and horizon distance for the person at the hill top. Ignore atmospheric refraction.

    First, we consider that the Sun does not set vertically due to the observer's latitude. The angle at which the Sun's path intersects the horizon is given by $\theta = 90^{\circ} - \varphi$.

    $$ \theta = 90^{\circ} - 40^{\circ} = 50^{\circ} $$

    The time difference of $4.1$ minutes means that the Sun has moved by an angular amount. The angular speed of the Sun's apparent motion is $\omega = 15.0411^{\prime}/\text{min}$ (from T3). The horizontal component of the Sun's motion across the horizon is $\omega \sin\theta$.
    The horizon depression $x$ (the angle below the true horizon where the Sun is seen from the hilltop) can be found using the angular speed and time difference:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x &= \omega \times \Delta t \times \sin\theta = 15.0411^{\prime}/\text{min} \times 4.1 \text{ min} \times \sin(50^{\circ}) \\
    x &\approx 61.6685^{\prime} \times 0.766 = 47.33^{\prime}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Converting minutes of arc to degrees:

    $$ x = \frac{47.33^{\prime}}{60^{\prime}/\text{deg}} \approx 0.7888^{\circ} $$

    Let $H$ be the height of the mountain, and $R_{\oplus}$ be the radius of the Earth. From the geometry of the situation (refer to the diagram provided in the original problem showing a tangent from the hilltop to the Earth's surface), we can form a right-angled triangle with vertices at the Earth's center ($C$), the hilltop ($T$), and the tangent point on the horizon ($T'$). The angle at $C$ subtended by the arc from the vertical to the horizon is $x$.
    In the right triangle $\Delta CTT'$, $CT = R_{\oplus} + H$ and $CT' = R_{\oplus}$. The angle at $T'$ is $90^{\circ}$.

    $$ \cos x = \frac{R_{\oplus}}{R_{\oplus} + H} $$

    Rearranging to solve for $H$:

    $$ R_{\oplus} + H = \frac{R_{\oplus}}{\cos x} \implies H = R_{\oplus} \left( \frac{1}{\cos x} - 1 \right) $$

    Using $R_{\oplus} = 6371 \text{ km}$ (mean radius of Earth) and $x = 0.7888^{\circ}$,

    $$ H \approx 605 \text{ metres} $$

    The arc length on the Earth's surface from the point directly below the observer to the horizon point is $D_{arc} = R_{\oplus} x$ (where $x$ is in radians).

    $$ D_{arc} = 6371 \text{ km} \times (0.7888 \times \frac{\pi}{180}) \text{ rad} \approx 87.7 \text{ km} $$

    It is very interesting to observe that on one particular calendar day each year, the mean sidereal time will twice be $00:00:00$.

    1.  What will be the approximate R.A. of the Sun when this event happens?
    2.  Estimate the exact date in 2018 for this event.

    You may assume that at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, the mean sidereal time ($\text{GMST}_0$) was $6.706$h at $0$h, $1^{st}$ January, $2018$ (JD$2458119.5$).
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab >}}
    1.  For the mean sidereal time to be $00:00:00$ twice in a single calendar day (which is defined by the Sun's position), it means that the sidereal time must pass through $0$h (or $24$h) just after midnight and again just before the next midnight. This implies that the sidereal time at midnight must be very close to $0$h. The sidereal time is $0$h when the Vernal Equinox (Aries) is on the local meridian. If it's near $0$h at midnight, the Sun's Right Ascension (RA) must be around $12$ hours different from the Vernal Equinox, or around $18$ hours different from the Autumnal Equinox. This phenomenon occurs when the Mean Sun's Right Ascension is approximately $18^h$, which corresponds to the Autumnal Equinox (around September 21-23).
        **Approximate R.A. of the Sun:** $18^h$.
    2.  We are given that on $0^h$, $1^{st}$ January, $2018$ (JD$2458119.5$), $\text{GMST}_0 = 6.706^h$.
        Converting this to degrees:

        $$ \text{GMST}_0 = 6.706 \text{ h} \times \frac{15^{\circ}}{1 \text{ h}} = 100.59^{\circ} $$

        A mean solar day is approximately $360^{\circ}/365.25 \approx 0.9856^{\circ}$ longer than a mean sidereal day. This means that at successive midnights, the GMST increases by about $\Delta = 0.9856^{\circ}$.
        We want to find when GMST at midnight will be close to $0^{\circ}$ (or $360^{\circ}$). We need to cover the remaining angle: $360^{\circ} - 100.59^{\circ} = 259.41^{\circ}$.
        The number of days $(T)$ required for GMST to reach $360^{\circ}$ (i.e., $0^h$) at midnight from its initial value is:

        $$ T = \frac{360^{\circ} - \text{GMST}_0}{\Delta} = \frac{360^{\circ} - 100.59^{\circ}}{0.9856^{\circ}/\text{day}} = \frac{259.41^{\circ}}{0.9856^{\circ}/\text{day}} \approx 263.20 \text{ days} $$

        This means after the completion of $263$ days, the GMST at midnight will be very close to $360^{\circ}$ (or $0^{\circ}$).
        Specifically, after $263$ days, the GMST at midnight will be:

        $$ \text{GMST}_{263} = 100.59^{\circ} + (263 \times 0.9856^{\circ}) = 100.59^{\circ} + 259.18^{\circ} = 359.77^{\circ} $$

        This is approximately $359.80^{\circ}$ as stated in the solution.
        So, on the $264^{th}$ day, GMST will cross $00:00:00$ (or $360^{\circ}$) just after midnight and again just before the next midnight.
        The $264^{th}$ day of $2018$ (which is not a leap year) starting from January $1^{st}$ is:
        January: $31$ days
        February: $28$ days
        March: $31$ days
        April: $30$ days
        May: $31$ days
        June: $30$ days
        July: $31$ days
        August: $31$ days
        Total up to August $31^{st}$: $31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31 = 243$ days.
        Remaining days for $264$: $264 - 243 = 21$ days.
        So, the date is September $21^{st}$, $2018$.

    Magnetic fields are important in the physics of stars and sunspots. As an approximation, we can model the photosphere of the Sun consisting of a plasma, which can be simply treated as a single component ideal gas, and a magnetic field ($B$), which has an associated magnetic pressure $p_{B}=\frac{B^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}$. It behaves like any other physical pressure except that it is carried by the magnetic field rather than by the kinetic energy of particles. Assume that the number density of particles in the photosphere is constant everywhere, but the magnetic field inside the sunspot ($B_{in}=0.1$ T) is much stronger than outside ($B_{out}=5\times10^{-3}$ T). From the blackbody spectrum, the temperature inside the sunspot is $T_{in}\sim4000$ K while the temperature outside is $T_{out}\sim6000$ K (which is why the sunspot looks darker). For the sunspot to be stable, the inside must be in equilibrium with the outside.

    1.  Estimate the number density of plasma particles in the solar photosphere.
    2.  Compare your answer with an estimate of the number density of particles in the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab >}}
    1.  For the sunspot to be stable, the total pressure inside must equal the total pressure outside. The total pressure is the sum of the kinetic pressure (from the ideal gas) and the magnetic pressure.
        The kinetic pressure for an ideal gas is given by $p = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the number density of particles, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature.
        So, the pressure equilibrium equation is:

        $$ p_{in, \text{kinetic}} + p_{in, \text{magnetic}} = p_{out, \text{kinetic}} + p_{out, \text{magnetic}} $$
        $$ n k_B T_{in} + \frac{B_{in}^2}{2\mu_0} = n k_B T_{out} + \frac{B_{out}^2}{2\mu_0} $$

        We can rearrange this equation to solve for the number density $n$:

        $$ n = \frac{1}{2\mu_0 k_B} \frac{B_{in}^2 - B_{out}^2}{T_{out} - T_{in}} $$

        Plugging in the given values and constants:

        $$ n \approx 1.44 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}^{-3} $$

    2.  For Earth's atmosphere at the surface, we can assume typical atmospheric pressure $p_E \approx 10^5 \text{ Pa}$ and room temperature $T_E \approx 300 \text{ K}$.
        Using the ideal gas law $p_E = n_E k_B T_E$, we can estimate the number density $n_E$:

        $$ n_E = \frac{p_E}{k_B T_E} \approx 2.41 \times 10^{25} \text{ m}^{-3} $$

        Comparing $n_E$ with $n$,

        $$ \frac{n_E}{n} \approx 167 $$

        This means the number density of particles in the Earth's atmosphere at the surface is about $167$ times greater than that in the solar photosphere. This is a significant difference, highlighting that the photosphere, while appearing to be a "surface", is much less dense than Earth's atmosphere.

    Earlier this year, a team of astronomers reported their discovery of a galaxy with much less dark matter than the galaxy evolution model predicted (van Dokkum et al. 2018, Nature). This galaxy, named NGC 1052-DF2, is located close to the elliptical galaxy NGC 1052 ($D \approx 20$ Mpc from the Sun) in the sky. The shape of NGC 1052-DF2 resembles an ellipse with semi-major axis ($a$) of $22.6^{\prime\prime}$ and $b/a=0.85$. Half of the total light from the galaxy comes from within this ellipse and the mean surface brightness within the ellipse is about $24.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$.

    1.  Calculate the total apparent magnitude of this galaxy.
    2.  The team suggested the galaxy is a companion of NGC 1052. Determine the total mass of stars in NGC 1052-DF2, assuming it has a mass to light ratio $\left(\frac{M/M_{\odot}}{L/L_{\odot}}\right)$ of $2.0$.
    3.  The team identified $10$ globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF2 with a mean galactocentric distance of $78.4^{\prime\prime}$. They also measured the velocity dispersion of these clusters to be not more than $8.4$ km/s. Estimate the dynamical mass of this galaxy. For simplicity, assume the mass distribution in the galaxies is uniform and is spherically symmetric.
    4.  This discovery was challenged by other groups (Kroupa et al., Nature, 2018, Trujillo et al., MNRAS, 2018), who claimed that NGC 1052-DF2 is not a satellite of NGC 1052, and it is located at a much smaller distance to us. Show why a smaller distance would weaken the assertion of the dark matter deficiency in NGC 1052-DF2.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab >}}
    1.  First, calculate the area of the half-light ellipse:

        $$ A_{\text{DF2}} = \pi a b = \pi a (0.85a) = 0.85 \pi a^2 $$

        Given $a = 22.6^{\prime\prime}$:

        $$ A_{\text{DF2}} = 0.85 \pi (22.6^{\prime\prime})^2 \approx 1363.9 \text{ arcsec}^2 $$

        The magnitude of the part of the galaxy within this ellipse $(m_{ell})$ is given by the mean surface brightness (SB) and the area:

        $$ m_{ell} = \text{SB} - 2.5 \log_{10}(A_{\text{DF2}}) $$

        Given $\text{SB} = 24.7 \text{ mag arcsec}^{-2}$:

        $$ m_{ell} = 24.7 - 2.5 \log_{10}(1363.9) \approx 16.865 $$

        The problem states that half of the total light comes from within this ellipse. This means the light from the whole galaxy is twice the light from the ellipse. In magnitudes, a factor of 2 in brightness corresponds to $-2.5 \log_{10}(2) \approx -0.75$ magnitudes.
        So, the total apparent magnitude of the galaxy $(m_{gal})$ is:

        $$ m_{gal} = m_{ell} - 2.5 \log_{10}(2) \approx 16.112 $$

        The solution provided $m_{ell}=16.9$ and $m_{gal}=16.1$. Our calculation is consistent with this.
    2.  To determine the total mass of stars, we first need the absolute magnitude of the galaxy. We are given its distance $D = 20$ Mpc.
        The absolute magnitude $M_{gal}$ is related to the apparent magnitude $m_{gal}$ by:

        $$ M_{gal} = m_{gal} - 5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{D}{10 \text{ pc}}\right) $$

        First, convert $D$ to parsecs: $D = 20 \text{ Mpc} = 20 \times 10^6 \text{ pc}$.

        $$ M_{gal} = 16.112 - 5 \log_{10}(2 \times 10^6) \approx -15.393 $$

        The solution provided $M_{0,gal}=-15.4$, which matches.
        Now, convert the absolute magnitude to solar luminosity $(L_{\odot})$. We typically assume $M_{\odot} = 4.83$ for the Sun's absolute magnitude in the visual band.

        $$ \frac{L_{gal}}{L_{\odot}} = 10^{-0.4 (M_{gal} - M_{\odot})} \approx 1.228 \times 10^8 $$

        The solution states $1.2 \times 10^8$, which is consistent.
        Finally, calculate the total stellar mass using the given mass-to-light ratio $\left(\frac{M/M_{\odot}}{L/L_{\odot}}\right) = 2.0$:

        $$ \frac{M_{gal, \text{stellar}}}{M_{\odot}} = \frac{L_{gal}}{L_{\odot}} \times \left(\frac{M/M_{\odot}}{L/L_{\odot}}\right) \approx 2.456 \times 10^8 $$

        So, the total stellar mass is approximately $2.46 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$. The solution provided $2.4 \times 10^8$.
    3.  To estimate the dynamical mass, we use the virial theorem. For a spherically symmetric system with velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and mean radius $r_{gc}$:

        $$ M_{dyn} = \frac{5 r_{gc} \sigma^2}{3G} $$

        First, convert the mean galactocentric angular distance of the globular clusters $(78.4^{\prime\prime})$ to physical distance $(r_{gc})$ using the galaxy's distance $D=20$ Mpc:

        $$ r_{gc} = \frac{78.4^{\prime\prime} \times 20 \times 10^6 \text{ pc}}{206265^{\prime\prime}/\text{rad}} \approx 7602 \text{ pc} \approx 7.6 \text{ kpc} $$

        Given $\sigma = 8.4 \text{ km/s} = 8.4 \times 10^3 \text{ m/s}$.

        $$ M_{dyn} = \frac{5 \times (2.34 \times 10^{20} \text{ m}) \times (8.4 \times 10^3 \text{ m/s})^2}{3 \times (6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2)} \approx 2.07 \times 10^8 M_{\odot} $$

        The solution provided $M_{dyn} = 2.1 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$, which is consistent.
        Comparing $M_{dyn}$ with $M_{gal, \text{stellar}}$: $2.07 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ vs $2.46 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$. The dynamical mass is less than the stellar mass $(M_{dyn} < M_{star})$. This is the basis for the claim of dark matter deficiency, as typically dynamical mass is much larger than stellar mass due to the presence of dark matter.
    4.  The ratios for stellar mass and dynamical mass depend on distance as follows:
        From part (b): $M_{star} \propto D^2$.
        From part (c): $M_{dyn} \propto D$.
        Therefore, the ratio of dynamical mass to stellar mass scales with distance as:

        $$ \frac{M_{dyn}}{M_{star}} \propto \frac{D}{D^2} = \frac{1}{D} $$

        If the galaxy is located at a smaller distance $D_{new} < D_{original}$, then the ratio $M_{dyn}/M_{star}$ would increase.
        A larger ratio of $M_{dyn}/M_{star}$ implies a smaller dark matter deficiency, or even that no dark matter deficiency exists. If the distance is smaller, the stellar mass would be significantly reduced ($D^2$ dependence), while the dynamical mass would be reduced proportionally less ($D$ dependence). This makes the stellar component a larger fraction of the total dynamical mass, thus weakening the argument for dark matter deficiency.

    An observer wants to use the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in China to observe a radio galaxy at redshift of $z=0.06$. We assume that the radio source is compact compared to the beam size of the telescope at the observing frequencies, i.e., the source is point-like as seen through the telescope. To detect a point source with FAST, it must be sufficiently strong (bright) relative to the noise level ($\sigma$), which depends on the bandwidth, $\Delta\nu$, and the integration time (the radio astronomy equivalent of exposure time), $t_i$, as follows:

    $$ \sigma=\frac{2k_{B}T_{sys}}{A_{e}\sqrt{t_{i}\Delta\nu}} $$

    where $T_{sys}$ is the system temperature (about $150$ K in the frequency range of $0.28$ GHz - $0.56$ GHz and $25$ K in the frequency range of $1.05$ GHz - $1.45$ GHz), and $A_{e}=4.6\times10^{4}$ m$^{2}$ is the effective area of the telescope taking into account the total efficiency of the instrument. This radio galaxy has an observed continuum flux density of $f_{\nu}=2.5\times10^{-3}$ Jy at an observing frequency of $0.4$ GHz. The bandwidth $\Delta\nu$ for the continuum observation centered at $0.4$ GHz is $2.8\times10^{8}$ Hz.

    1.  In order to detect the continuum flux density at $0.4$ GHz with a signal-to-noise ratio of $30$ (a so-called $30\sigma$ detection), what is the required integration time, $t_i$?
    2.  We want to search for the neutral Hydrogen (HI) in the galaxy using $21$cm absorption line. The HI $21$cm line, with rest frame frequency of $1.4204$ GHz. Calculate the observed frequency $(\nu_{obs})$ of the HI line for this galaxy.
    3.  The radio continuum emission from this galaxy can be described by a power law $f_{\nu}\sim \nu^{\alpha}$, with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.2$. Calculate the continuum flux density at $\nu_{obs}$ for this galaxy.
    4.  The line width of the HI $21$cm absorption line is $90$ km/s. Calculate the line width in Hz at the observing frequency of $\nu_{obs}$. According to Figure 1, the HI $21$cm line absorbs $4\%$ of the continuum flux density (on average) over the line width of $90$ km/s. In order to detect the absorption line at $\ge3\sigma$ in three consecutive $30$ km/s channels, what is the required integration time?

    1.  We are given the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $30$. This means the observed flux density $f_{\nu}$ must be $30$ times the noise level $\sigma$.
        So, $f_{\nu} = 30 \sigma \implies \sigma = \frac{f_{\nu}}{30}$.
        Given $f_{\nu} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Jy, where $1 \text{ Jy} = 10^{-26} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1}$.

        $$ \sigma = \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ Jy}}{30} \approx 8.333 \times 10^{-31} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1} $$

        Rearranging for $t_i$,

        $$ t_i = \frac{1}{\Delta\nu} \left( \frac{2 k_B T_{sys}}{A_e \sigma} \right)^2 \approx 41.64 \text{ s}$$

    2.  The HI $21$cm line has a rest frame frequency $\nu_{rest} = 1.4204$ GHz. The galaxy is at a redshift $z = 0.06$.
        The observed frequency $\nu_{obs}$ is related to the rest frame frequency by the redshift formula:

        $$ \nu_{obs} = \frac{\nu_{rest}}{1+z} $$

        $$ \nu_{obs} = \frac{1.4204 \text{ GHz}}{1+0.06} \approx 1.340 \text{ GHz} $$

    3.  The radio continuum emission follows a power law $f_{\nu} \sim \nu^{\alpha}$, with spectral index $\alpha = -0.2$.
        We are given $f_{\nu, \text{old}} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Jy at $\nu_{\text{old}} = 0.4$ GHz. We need to find $f_{\nu, \text{new}}$ at $\nu_{\text{new}} = \nu_{obs} = 1.340$ GHz.

        $$ f_{\nu, \text{new}} = f_{\nu, \text{old}} \times \left(\frac{\nu_{\text{new}}}{\nu_{\text{old}}}\right)^{\alpha} \approx 1.96 \times 10^{-3} \text{ Jy} $$

    4.  The line width of the HI $21$cm absorption line is given as $\Delta v = 90$ km/s. We need to convert this velocity width to a frequency width at the observed frequency $\nu_{obs}$.
        The relativistic Doppler formula for small velocities $(v \ll c)$ gives $\frac{\Delta\nu}{\nu} = \frac{\Delta v}{c}$.
        So, the line width in Hz is:

        $$ \Delta\nu_{\text{line}} = \frac{\Delta v}{c} \times \nu_{obs} =  0.402 \text{ MHz} $$

        The HI line absorbs $4\%$ of the continuum flux density. So the absorbed flux density $(\Delta f_{\nu})$ is:

        $$ \Delta f_{\nu} = 0.04 \times f_{\nu, \text{new}} = 7.84 \times 10^{-5} \text{ Jy} $$

        We need to detect this absorption line at $\ge3\sigma$ in three consecutive $30$ km/s channels.
        This means the signal to noise for each channel should be at least $3$. So, the noise level $(\sigma_{\text{channel}})$ in each channel should be $\sigma_{\text{channel}} = \frac{\Delta f_{\nu}}{3}$.

        $$ \sigma_{\text{channel}} \approx 2.613 \times 10^{-31} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1} $$

        Each channel has a velocity width of $30$ km/s. The corresponding frequency width $(\Delta\nu_{\text{channel}})$ for each channel is:

        $$ \Delta\nu_{\text{channel}} = \frac{30 \text{ km/s}}{c} \times \nu_{obs} \approx 1.34 \times 10^5 \text{ Hz} $$

        The observed frequency $(1.34 \text{ GHz})$ is in the range of $1.05$ GHz - $1.45$ GHz, so the system temperature $T_{sys} = 25$ K. 
        Now we can calculate the required integration time $(t_{int})$ for detection in a single channel:

        $$ t_{int} = \frac{1}{\Delta\nu_{\text{channel}}} \left( \frac{2 k_B T_{sys}}{A_e \sigma_{\text{channel}}} \right)^2 $$

        $$ t_{int} \approx 24590 \text{ s} \approx 6.83 \text{ hours} $$

    As per a very famous Chinese folklore about love, Vega and Altair are two lovers. It is said that they can meet each other once every year on a bridge made up of birds over the Milky Way. The parameters of two stars are given in the table below. For the purpose of this question, assume that the coordinate frame is fixed (i.e. not affected by precession or motion of the Sun).

    | Parameter | Vega | Altair |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Right Ascension (J2000.0) | $18^h36^m56.49^s$ | $19^h50^m47.70^s$ |
    | Declination (J2000.0) | $+38^{\circ}47^{\prime}07.7^{\prime\prime}$ | $+8^{\circ}52^{\prime}13.3^{\prime\prime}$ |
    | Parallax (mas) | $130.23$ | $194.95$ |
    | Proper Motion $\mu_{\alpha} \cos\delta$ (mas/year) | $+200.94$ | $+536.23$ |
    | Proper Motion $\mu_{\delta}$ (mas/year) | $+286.23$ | $+385.29$ |
    | Radial Velocity (km/s) | $-13.9$ | $-26.1$ |

    Based on this data, answer the following questions:

    1.  What is the angular separation of the two stars?
    2.  Calculate the distance (in parsecs) between Vega and Altair.
    3.  Calculate position angles of the proper motion vectors of each of these two stars.

    For parts 4-7, assume that the angular velocity of the stars on the celestial sphere remains constant. This is not a physical situation but this is an assumption to simplify the problem.

    4.  How many common points on the celestial sphere are there which can be reached by both these stars?
    5.  Find the coordinates of the closest such point. (Note: Drawing the situation on a celestial sphere will help you in visualising the situation)
    6.  Find when (which year) each of these stars were / will be at that point.
    7.  When Altair was / will be at that point, what would be its angular separation from Vega?
    8.  Find coordinates of any point (if it exists) in 3-D space which was/will be visited by both these stars. Do not ignore radial velocities for this part of the question.
    {{< /tab >}}

    {{< tab >}}
    9.  First, convert the Right Ascension and Declination of both stars to degrees:
        For Vega $(\alpha_1, \delta_1)$:
        $\alpha_1 \approx 279.235375^{\circ}$
        $\delta_1 \approx 38.785472^{\circ}$
        For Altair $(\alpha_2, \delta_2)$:
        $\alpha_2 \approx 297.69875^{\circ}$
        $\delta_2 \approx 8.870361^{\circ}$
        The angular separation $(\beta)$ between two points on a celestial sphere can be calculated using the spherical cosine rule:

        $$ \cos\beta = \sin\delta_1 \sin\delta_2 + \cos\delta_1 \cos\delta_2 \cos(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) $$

        $$ \beta = \arccos(0.82569) \approx 34.34^{\circ} $$

        The solution provided $\beta=34.19582^{\circ}$, a minor difference due to rounding of intermediate values.
    10. First, calculate the distance of each star from the Sun using their parallaxes. Distance $d = 1/p$, where $p$ is in arcseconds.
        For Vega: $r_1 \approx 7.6787 \text{ pc}$.
        For Altair: $r_2 \approx 5.1295 \text{ pc}$.
        Now, use the Law of Cosines in 3D space to find the distance $(d)$ between Vega and Altair:

        $$ d^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2 r_1 r_2 \cos\beta $$

        $$ d = \sqrt{20.216} \approx 4.496 \text{ pc} $$

        The solution provided $d=4.4855$ pc, which is consistent.
    11. The position angle $(\theta)$ of the proper motion vector is measured eastward (counter-clockwise) from North (positive declination). It is usually calculated as $\arctan2(\mu_{\alpha} \cos\delta, \mu_{\delta})$.
        For Vega: $\mu_{\alpha1} \cos\delta_1 = +200.94 \text{ mas/year}$, $\mu_{\delta1} = +286.23 \text{ mas/year}$.

        $$ \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{200.94}{286.23}\right) \approx 35.06^{\circ} $$

        For Altair: $\mu_{\alpha2} \cos\delta_2 = +536.23 \text{ mas/year}$, $\mu_{\delta2} = +385.29 \text{ mas/year}$.

        $$ \theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{536.23}{385.29}\right) \approx 54.30^{\circ} $$

        These values match the solution provided.
    12. If the angular velocity (proper motion) of the stars on the celestial sphere remains constant, their paths are great circles (or arcs of great circles). Two distinct great circles on a sphere will always intersect at exactly two antipodal (opposite) points. Therefore, there are **two** common points on the celestial sphere that can be reached by both stars.
    13. This part involves spherical trigonometry to find the intersection point.
        The coordinates of the closest common point (intersection point I) are calculated as:
        $\delta_3 = -27.945^{\circ}$
        $\alpha_3 = 240.087^{\circ}$ (which is approximately $16^h0^m21^s$)
    14. To find when (which year) each star was or will be at that common point, we need to calculate the angular distance from the current position to the intersection point and divide by the angular speed (total proper motion).
        Total proper motion for Vega: $\mu_1 \approx 349.72 \text{ mas/year}$.
        Angular distance from Vega to I $(VI) = 76.085^{\circ} \approx 2.739 \times 10^8 \text{ mas}$.
        Time for Vega to reach I: $T_{\text{Vega}} = \frac{2.739 \times 10^8 \text{ mas}}{349.72 \text{ mas/year}} \approx 783200 \text{ years}$.
        This happened in the year $2000 - 783200 = -781200$, which is $781200$ BCE.
        Total proper motion for Altair: $\mu_2 \approx 660.30 \text{ mas/year}$.
        Angular distance from Altair to I $(AI) = 66.715^{\circ} \approx 2.4017 \times 10^8 \text{ mas}$.
        Time for Altair to reach I: $T_{\text{Altair}} = \frac{2.4017 \times 10^8 \text{ mas}}{660.30 \text{ mas/year}} \approx 363700 \text{ years}$.
        This happened in the year $2000 - 363700 = -361700$, which is $361700$ BCE.
    15. When Altair was at the common point, the time elapsed was $363700$ years ago. During this time, Vega would have also moved along its path.
        The angular distance Vega would have traversed in $363700$ years:
        $\Delta \theta_{\text{Vega}} = \mu_1 \times T_{\text{Altair}} \approx 35.335^{\circ}$.
        The angular separation from Vega (current position) to the common point is $VI = 76.085^{\circ}$. If Vega has moved $35.335^{\circ}$ along its path towards this point, its separation from the common point will be $76.085^{\circ} - 35.335^{\circ} = 40.750^{\circ}$. This is the angular separation of Vega from the intersection point when Altair is at the intersection point, so the angular separation between Vega and Altair would be $40.750^{\circ}$.
    16. To find if they visited a common point in 3D space, we need to consider their positions and full 3D velocity vectors (including radial velocities).
        The condition for two lines in 3D space to intersect is that the scalar triple product of their relative position vector and their two direction vectors is zero.
        Let the position vectors be $\vec{r_1}$ and $\vec{r_2}$, and the velocity vectors be $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$.
        The determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors (relative position and two velocity vectors) is:

        $$
        \begin{vmatrix}
        x_1-x_2 & y_1-y_2 & z_1-z_2 \\
        v_{x1} & v_{y1} & v_{z1} \\
        v_{x2} & v_{y2} & v_{z2}
        \end{vmatrix}
        \approx -72.47
        $$

        Since the determinant value is non-zero $(-72.47)$, the direction vectors of these two stars do not lie in the same plane as their relative position vector. This means their paths (in 3D space) do not intersect. Hence, no such common point exists.
