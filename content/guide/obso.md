## Zodiac

The zodiac is a belt shaped region of the skyy that extends about 8 degrees north and south of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere, which is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees to the celestial equator. It mainly contains 13 constellations

Ophiuchus is not considered a zodiac sign by astrologers, but it is included in the list of constellations that the Sun passes through.

Point | Date | Constellation |
------|------|-------------|
Vernal Equinox | Mar 20 | Pisces |
Summer Solstice | Jun 21 | Gemini |
Autumnal Equinox | Sep 23 | Virgo |
Winter Solstice | Dec 21 | Sagittarius |

The north ecliptic pole (NEP) lies in Draco, at equatorial coordinates (18h 3m, +66° 33′). The south ecliptic pole (SEP) lies in Dorado, at equatorial coordinates (6h 3m, -66° 33′).

Constellations not on the ecliptic but close enough that planets and the moon can occasionally be found in them include Cetus, Pegasus, Aquila, Scutum, Hydrus, Corvus, Crater, Sextans, Canis Minor, Auriga and Orion.

## Celestial Equator

The celestial equator is inclined at an angle of ~23.5$^\circ$ with respect to the ecliptic, but varies from 22$^\circ$ to 24$^\circ$ due to nutation. The celestial equator is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere. It is an imaginary line that divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. The constellations through which the celestial equator passes (in order) are

- Pisces
- Cetus
- Taurus
- Eradanus
- Orion
- Monoceros
- Canis Minor
- Hydrus
- Leo
- Virgo
- Serpens (Caput)
- Ophiuchus
- Serpens (Cauda)
- Aquila
- Aquarius

The celestial equator also contains the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, which are the points where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic. The vernal equinox is the point in the sky where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north, while the autumnal equinox is the point where the Sun crosses from north to south.

The north celestial pole (NCP) lies in the constellation Ursa Minor, at equatorial coordinates (0h, 90°). The south celestial pole (SCP) lies in the constellation Octans, at equatorial coordinates (0h, -90°).

## Galactic Equator

The galactic equator is the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, which is inclined at an angle of ~60$^\circ$ with respect to the celestial equator. The galactic equator is an imaginary line that divides the sky into the galactic northern and southern hemispheres. The constellations through which the galactic equator passes (in order) are

- Sagittarius
- Serpens
- Scutum
- Aquila
- Sagitta
- Vulpecula
- Cygnus
- Cepheus
- Cassiopeia
- Camelopardalis
- Perseus
- Auriga
- Taurus
- Gemini
- Orion
- Monoceros
- Canis Major
- Puppis
- Vela
- Carina
- Crux
- Centaurus
- Norma
- Ara
- Scorpius
- Ophiuchus

The north galactic pole (NGP) lies in the constellation Coma Berenices, at equatorial coordinates (12h 51m, +27° 7′). The south galactic pole (SGP) lies in the constellation Sculptor, at equatorial coordinates (0h 51m, -27° 7′).
The galactic center (GC) lies in the constellation Sagittarius, at equatorial coordinates (17h 45m, -29° 0′). The galactic anticenter (GAC) lies in the constellation Auriga, at equatorial coordinates (5h 45m, +29° 0′).

The solar apex is the point in the sky towards which the Sun is moving relative to the LSR. It is located in the constellation Hercules, at equatorial coordinates (18h 28m, +30° 0′). The solar antapex is located in Canis Major, at equatorial coordinates (6h 28m, -30° 0′).

## Selenographic Coordinates

The selenographic coordinate system is used to refer to locations on the surface of Earth's moon. Any position on the lunar surface can be referenced by specifying two numerical values, which are comparable to the latitude and longitude of Earth. The longitude gives the position east or west of the Moon's prime meridian, which is the line passing from the lunar north pole through the point on the lunar surface directly facing Earth to the lunar south pole. The latitude gives the position north or south of the lunar equator. The fundamental location in the selenographic coordinate system is the small, bowl shaped satellite crater 'Mösting A', whose coordinates are defined as (5° 12' 39.6'' W, 3° 12′ 43.2′′ S).

## Brightest Objects in Night Sky

The coordinates of Arcturus ($\alpha$ Boötes) are (14h 15m 39.7s, +19° 10′ 56′′). The coordinates of Kochab ($β$ Ursae Minoris) are (14h 50m 42.33s, +74° 9′ 20′′).
