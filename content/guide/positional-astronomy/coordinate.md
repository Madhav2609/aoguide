## Horizontal (Alt-Az) Coordinate System

Any point in the sky can be described by its altitude and azimuth. The horizontal coordinate system is based on the observer's local horizon, with the zenith (the point directly above the observer) at $90^\circ$ altitude and the nadir (the point directly below the observer) at $-90^\circ$ altitude.

Any arc passing through the zenith and perpendicular to the horizon is called a vertical circle. The altitude $a$ of a point $X$ is the angle between the horizon and the point, as measured along the vertical circle passing through the point and the zenith. The zenith angle $z$ is the angle between the zenith and the point, which is equal to $90^\circ - a$. The altitude is positive above the horizon and negative below it. It ranges from $-90^\circ$ at the nadir to $90^\circ$ at the zenith.

The azimuth $A$ of a point $X$ is the angle between the north direction and the projection of the point onto the horizontal plane, measured eastwards from north. The azimuth ranges from $0^\circ$ at the north point, $90^\circ$ at the east point, $180^\circ$ at the south point, and $270^\circ$ at the west point. In the southern hemisphere, azimuth is measured from the south point eastwards.

The coordinates of a point in the horizontal coordinate system are given by the pair $(a, A)$, where $a$ is the altitude and $A$ is the azimuth. These change with the observer's location and the time of observation, as the position of celestial objects changes due to the rotation of the Earth.
