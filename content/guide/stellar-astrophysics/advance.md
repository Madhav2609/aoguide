## Lane-Emden equation

The Laneâ€“Emden equation is a dimensionless equation that describes a Newtonian self-gravitating, spherically symmetric, polytropic fluid. It is named after astrophysicists Jonathan Homer Lane and Robert Emden. The equation reads:

$$\boxed{ \frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi^2} \left( \xi^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \xi} \right) + \theta^n = 0 }$$

where $\xi$ is a dimensionless radius and $\theta$ is related to the density, and thus the pressure, by $\rho = \rho_c \theta^n$, where  $\rho_c$ is the central density. The index $n$ is the polytropic index that appears in the polytropic equation of state,

$$P = K \rho^{1 + \frac{1}{n}}$$

where $P$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and density, respectively, and $K$ is a constant of proportionality. The standard boundary conditions are $\theta(0) = 1$ and $\theta'(0) = 0$. Solutions thus describe the pressure and density profile with radius and are known as polytropes of index $n$. These are commonly used to model stars.

### Derivation

Consider a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. Mass is conserved and thus described by the continuity equation

$$\frac{dm}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho$$

where $\rho$ is a function of $r$. The equation of hydrostatic equillibrium is

$$ \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{dP}{dr} = - \frac{Gm}{r^2} $$

where $m$ is also a function of $r$. Differentiating again gives

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{dP}{dr} \right) &= \frac{2Gm}{r^3} - \frac{G}{r^2} \frac{dm}{dr} \nonumber \\&= - \frac{2}{\rho r} \frac{dP}{dr} - 4\pi G \rho \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

Rearranging gives

$$ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{r^2}{\rho} \frac{dP}{dr} \right) = -4 \pi G \rho $$

If we substitue the polytropic equation of state with $P = K \rho_c^{1 + \frac{1}{n}} \theta^{n+1}$ and $\rho = \rho_c \theta^n$, we have

$$ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 K \rho_c^\frac{1}{n} (n+1) \frac{d\theta}{dr} \right) = -4 \pi G \rho_c \theta^n $$

Gathering the constants and substituting $r = \alpha \xi$, where

$$ \alpha^2 = (n+1) K \rho_c^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} / 4\pi G, $$

we have the Lane-Emden equation

$$ \frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi^2} \left( \xi^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \xi} \right) + \theta^n = 0 $$

The boundary conditions are:

- $\theta(0) = 1$: The density at the center of the star is $\rho_c$.
- $\theta'(0) = 0$: The density gradient at the center is zero, avoiding any discontinuity.

The surface of the fluid is defined by the condition $\theta(\xi_R) = 0$, where $\xi_R$ is the radius of the fluid. Only solutions with $n < 5$ have a surface. All polytropes with $n \geq 5$ have infinite radii.

### Solutions

- $n = 0$

The Lane-Emden equation becomes $\frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi^2} \left( \xi^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \xi} \right) = 0$. Integrating, we find that the solution is

$$ \theta(\xi) = 1 - \frac{\xi^2}{6} $$

This gives the surface to be at $\xi_R = \sqrt{6}$. This solution corresponds to an incompressible fluid star, which has the same density everywhere.

- $n = 1$

The solution for $n = 1$ is

$$ \theta(\xi) = \frac{\sin(\xi)}{\xi} $$

This extends to infinity, hence has infinite radius, unless truncated artificially. We truncate the star at the first root, where $\xi_R = \pi$.

- $n = 5$

The solution for $n = 5$ is

$$ \theta(\xi) = \left( 1 + \frac{\xi^2}{3} \right)^{-1/2} $$

This solution has no surface, as it extends to infinity.

- $n = 1.5,\, 3$

The solution corresponding to $n = 1.5$ is of an adiabatic star supported by pressure of non relativistic gas, or a white dwarf.

The solution corresponding to $n = 3$ is of an adiabatic star supported by pressure of ultra-relativistic gas, or a neutron star.

### Physical Properties

The stellar radius is

$$ R = \alpha \xi_R = \left[ \frac{K}{G} \frac{n + 1}{4 \pi} \right]^{1/2} \rho_c^\frac{1-n}{2n} \xi_R $$

The stellar mass is

$$
\begin{align}
M &= \int_0^R 4 \pi r^2 \rho dr \nonumber \\&= 4 \pi \left( \frac{K}{G} \frac{n + 1}{4 \pi} \right)^{3/2} \rho_c^\frac{3-n}{2n} \left[ -\xi^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \xi} \right]_{\xi_R} \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

From this we get that

$$ M \propto R^\frac{n-1}{3n-1} $$

The average density of the star is

$$ \rho_{av} = \frac{3M}{4 \pi R^3} = \frac{3}{\xi_R^3} \left[ -\xi^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \xi} \right]_{\xi_R} \rho_c$$

The gravitational potential energy is

$$ \Omega = - \int_0^M \frac{GM_r dM_r}{r^2} = \frac{3}{5-n} \frac{GM^2}{R} $$
